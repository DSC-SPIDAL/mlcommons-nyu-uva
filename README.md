## Team

TODO: explaine what the different roles are and if they are fluent. e.g. is a coordinator only coordinating or also contributing to the coordination.
Reason I ask is that Laiba contacted us and seems to do right now the task of the coordinator ...

Roles:

Coordinator - Team coordination, writing, presenting, communication, leading 

ML specialist - develop and code ML solution (usually a person with solid knowledge/skills in ML) 

Researcher - scientific meaning, validity, context, literature review, etc
